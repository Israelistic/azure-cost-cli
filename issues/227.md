### Problem
Running `azure-cost diff` with `--output json` can produce output polluted with ANSI escape / color sequences, yielding invalid JSON (reported in issue #227). This prevents downstream tools (jq, parsers, CI steps) from consuming the output.

### Rationale
Machine‑readable output must be strictly valid JSON. Any stray escape sequences break automation.

### Proposed Solution
1. Ensure `JsonOutputFormatter` bypasses Spectre.Console entirely. Write directly to `Console.Out` (or return a string) using `System.Text.Json`.
2. Add global `--no-color` option and honor `NO_COLOR` env var to forcefully disable ALL ANSI.
3. Guard all JSON formatter code paths so no Spectre markup / styling is invoked.
4. Add a regression test asserting zero occurrences of ESC (`\u001b`) and successful deserialization.

### Implementation Notes
- Audit `WriteAccumulatedDiffCost` and any shared helpers.
- Consider a small helper `JsonOutput.Write(object model, bool pretty)` returning the string; then just `Console.WriteLine`.
- If today JSON is routed through an abstraction that can inject styling, add a raw mode.
- Provide a one‑line warning to stderr (not stdout) if mixed mode detected, but avoid writing any non‑JSON to stdout.

### Test Plan
- Unit/integration test: run diff on two small fixture snapshots with `-o json` -> parse with `JsonDocument.Parse`.
- Repeat with `NO_COLOR=1` and `--no-color` flags.
- Grep output for `"\u001b"` (should be none).

### Acceptance Criteria
- JSON output always parses successfully.
- No ANSI sequences present under any configuration.
- Tests failing if ANSI sneaks back in.
